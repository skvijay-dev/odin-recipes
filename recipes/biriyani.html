  <h3>About biriyani</h3>
  <P>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is made by layering fragrant basmati rice with tender pieces of marinated meat, such as chicken, beef, or mutton, and slow-cooking them together with a blend of rich spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. Often garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs, and boiled eggs, biryani is a festive dish that is loved for its bold taste and delicious, spicy aroma.</P>
